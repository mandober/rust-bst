# dots

Dotfiles galore. So far only wrt bash shell.

Sections
- bash rc
- readline rc
- vim rc
- utils rc
- commands rc
- bash functions
- bash scripts

Each $section is a dir in `~/dots/` with couple of subdirs:
- $section
- $section.d
- rc.d/
- work/
- dump/
- init/
- info/
- docs/

bash config:
- `~/dots/bash/` main dir
- `~/dots/bash/rc.d` parts of bash rc
- `~/dots/bash/init` parts of bash rc
- `~/dots/bash/docs` bash docs 
- `~/dots/bash/work` scratch space for work-in-progress
- `~/dots/bash/dump` indices of bash resources (e.g. index of bash keywords)
