# Terminal emulator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator

A terminal emulator is a program that emulates a *video terminal* within some other display architecture. Though typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal, the term terminal covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal emulator inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal window.

A terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its applications such as command-line interfaces (CLI) and text user interface (TUI) applications. These may be running either on the same machine or on a different one via telnet, ssh, dial-up, or over a direct serial connection. On Unix-like operating systems, it is common to have one or more terminal windows connected to the local machine.

Terminals usually support a set of escape sequences for controlling color, cursor position, etc. Examples include the family of terminal control sequence standards known as ECMA-48, ANSI X3.64 or ISO/IEC 6429.



The site https://vt100.net/ is dedicated to the video terminals produced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1970 to 1995, the period which coincides with the use of that technology.

The most famous of these is the VT100, a name which is recognised most often today as a setting in terminal emulation programs.
