# Console



A **text terminal** is a serial computer interface for text entry and display.

The **system console** is often a text terminal used to operate a computer. Modern computers have a built-in keyboard and display for the console. 

Linux has **virtual consoles** providing several text terminals on a single computer. Some computers have a console that consists only of buttons, dials, lights and switches (e.g. Altair).

Console is also used in the sense of a physical hardware device that houses a text terminal. Nowadays, gaming devices are also called consoles (e.g. Sony Playstation); a hand-held computer intended for gaming is also called a console (e.g. GameBoy); an RC tray filled with controls for flying a drone could also be called a console.

The fundamental type of application running on a *text terminal* is a *shell*, aka a *command-line interpreter*, that prompts the user to type in commands which it then executes. In a shell, most of *commands* are small applications themselves.
