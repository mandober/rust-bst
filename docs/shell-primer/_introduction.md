## User interface

User interface (UI) types
- command-line interface (CLI)
- text-based user interface (TUI)
- graphical user interface (GUI)

Typically, user interfaces only come in two flavors: text and graphical.

Text-based interfaces are the primal typeâ€¦, hmm, well no, they're not - there was a time before that, the so-called Before Text (BT) era. It was the worse of times with many a holes punctured piece of paper as input. The output was relayed as a sequence of low-fi timbral toness (the infamous brown notes) that would make users shit themselves if incorrectly interpreted. It was a time of literal bug infestations.

Anno Scripti brought text UIs with an austere look, bare-bones and no-nonsense attitude. Text-only user inteface came with the arrival of OG consoles/terminals. Console is nonsensically understood as a hardware device with buttons and dials, controlz and shit.

**Graphical user interface** (GUI) is the warm and fuzzy environment teaming with icons, toolbars, scrollbars, click-baiting buttons, drop-down menus, multiple-choice selections, radios and checkers, sex and candy, even an audio scheme. This luxory can be heavy on resources, GPU support is much appreciated.

**TUIs** attempt to emulate the look and feel of GUIs but in the cold terminal environment.

The basic I/O devices used by both types of UIs are a keyboard and a screen. Input is entered with the keyboard, but it is sprecific cosd it also need a screen to provide the feedback for the user. Output only uses the screen.
