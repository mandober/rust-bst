# Command

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)

Command is a generic term that needs to include all those things that can happen at the command line - things like aliases, functions, keywords, builtins, programs, possibly some others.

Typing in a name of some utility, whose parent directory is included in the PATH, instructs the shell to locate and execute that program. 

After the user submits it, the text they typed at the command line is just a raw string of text, initially devoid of meaning (shell as a *command interpreter*). This string of text is also called "a command line", and it represents an input for the shell to process and make sense of.
