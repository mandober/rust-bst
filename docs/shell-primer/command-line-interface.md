# Command-line interface

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface

A **command-line interface (CLI)** is a means of interacting with a computer by typing lines of text, called command-lines.

Command-line interfaces emerged in the mid-1960s, on computer terminals, as an interactive and user-friendly alternative to the *non-interactive interface* available with punched cards.

A **command-line interface (CLI)** is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system, in an interactive manner.

CLIs are made possible by command-line interpreters or command-line processors, which are programs that read command-lines and carry out the commands.
